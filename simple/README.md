# Simple.css for Bludit

As Kev Quirk puts it on [his website](https://simplecss.org/demo):
> Simple.css is a CSS framework that makes semantic HTML look good, really quickly.

I try to respect this philosophy by using a maximum of semantic HTML and adding a minimum of complementary styling to make it compatible with **Bludit**.

Note that **Simple.css** comes with two classes, `.button` (so a link looks like a button) and `.notice` (to create a notice box), you can use them in your pages. Dark / light mode is based on browser's settings.

Feel free to edit this theme so it meets your needs and please do raise issue if you find problems.
